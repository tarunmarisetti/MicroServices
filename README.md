# Spring Boot Microservices Architecture

This project demonstrates a complete **Spring Boot Microservices** system built using Java and Spring Cloud. It includes three core microservices:

- **Employee Service**
- **Department Service**
- **Organization Service**

All services are registered with **Eureka Service Registry**, and requests are routed through a **Spring Cloud API Gateway**.
